# 📊 Renewable Energy & Carbon Emissions Dashboard (Tableau Project)

This project explores the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy with a specific focus on the **United States**, visualized through an interactive **Tableau dashboard**. It highlights the environmental, economic, and technological impacts of adopting solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable sources.

Built using rich datasets from **IRENA** and **EIA**, this dashboard is designed to help policymakers, researchers, and citizens better understand how renewable energy influences **carbon emissions, job creation**, and energy generation trends.

## 🌍 Project Overview

As the world pushes toward sustainability, the U.S. has emerged as a focal point for energy innovation. This project answers key questions:

- How has the U.S. transitioned from non-renewable to renewable energy?
- Which states are leading (or lagging) in carbon efficiency?
- What is the relationship between clean energy adoption and carbon emission trends?
- How many jobs are being created in renewable sectors, and where?
